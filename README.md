Edited To Suit By Skrimbo_Jones

 This Program will copy a folder of your choice (Edit the $sourceDirectory variable in code to suit) on any windows 10 computer
 
 then copy it to the MAXUS drive opened in the Mass Storage App on your Flipper Zero and delete the evidence.
 
 NOTE: This could take a long time depending on the files being copied.
